# Bill Tipping Calculator
This is my submission for the Penn LPS Coding Challenge.
The application is a simple calculator that allows users to calculate
the amount of tip that should be paid on a given bill.

To see the deployed version go here:

The app should be mobile friendly, so feel free to give it a try on your
phone!

# Notes:
This app went through several different iterations, so the code base might not be as clean as intended!
For example, some of the dependencies aren't used: such as 'express'.
